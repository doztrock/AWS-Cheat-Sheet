# 💸 AWS Savings Plans

---

## 📌 Description  
**Savings Plans** is a flexible pricing model that offers **significant cost savings** (up to 72%) over On-Demand pricing in exchange for a **commitment to a consistent usage (e.g., $/hour)** over a 1 or 3-year term. It automatically applies to eligible usage across services.

---

## 🚀 Key Features  
- 💰 **Up to 72% savings** vs On-Demand pricing  
- 🕒 **1 or 3-year terms**, with **All Upfront**, **Partial Upfront**, or **No Upfront** payment options  
- 🔄 **Applies automatically** to matching usage — no need to assign to specific instances  
- 📦 Works across **EC2, Fargate, Lambda**  
- 📈 **Greater flexibility** than Reserved Instances (RIs)

---

## 🛠️ Use Cases  
- 🖥️ Steady-state workloads on EC2, Fargate, Lambda  
- 📉 Cost optimization across compute services  
- 🧾 Predictable compute spending  
- 🧠 When you need **flexibility** in instance family, size, OS, and region (with Compute SP)

## 🔁 Types of Savings Plans  

| Type              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Compute SP**    | Applies to any EC2 instance (any region, family, OS), also Fargate & Lambda |
| **EC2 Instance SP** | Locked to specific instance family & region (e.g., `m5` in `us-east-1`) but gives deeper discounts |

## 💰 Pricing  
- 💵 Commit to a consistent usage (e.g., $10/hour)

- 💲 Choose from **No Upfront**, **Partial**, or **All Upfront** payments
